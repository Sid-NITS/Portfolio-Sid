Hello! I'm Siddharth Shankar, currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Silchar (NIT Silchar). My journey into the world of technology began early, and I've been passionate about coding since class 8. I started with Java, and over the years, I've honed my skills and am now comfortably coding in C++.

When I'm not immersed in coding or studying, I love to unwind by watching movies and series. I have a knack for binge-watching and can complete long series in a surprisingly short amount of time! Gaming is another passion of mine, and I sometimes get a bit too competitive, but it's all in good fun.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch!
